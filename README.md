Finally i finished the Odin Project TodoList (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

I already finished this once but I had to rewrite it completely because I 1. Forgot to use modules, 2. The code was unnecessarily complex. I would still consider the code a bit confusing but ill try to stick to "SOLID" in
the future to hopefully make it more readable.

I dont know if its good practice to put alot of html directly into innerHTML but i dont see why it would be that much of a problem (except readability).

I wouldn't consider this project difficult, mainly time consuming.
